## Overview of project

This package (package name: me495_baxter_jar) allows Baxter to open and close a Tide bottle, using his left arm.

## How to run

A closed Tide bottle with an AR tag on the cap needs to be firmly attached (duct tape will suffice) to a table well within Baxter's reachable area. Once communication with Baxter is established run command:

`roslaunch me495_baxter_jar startup.launch`

If you would like to visualize Baxter and the tag in rviz to monitor what Baxter is seeing, run command:

`roslaunch me495_baxter_jar debug_ar_trakck.launch`

## State machine: nodes, services, and their functionality

The package operates similarly to a state machine. Upon completion of each task, the next one is called using a service.
